# The client decides which conversations belong in the "Unassigned" and "Mine" tabs by filtering the
# store locally, while the badge next to each tab is a count the server sent. Nothing used to tie the
# two definitions together, so they could drift apart with every test on both sides still green: the
# server counted a bot-held conversation as assigned and the client listed it as unassigned, and the
# tab only disagreed with its own badge once a visit to "All" had loaded those conversations into the
# store (#416).
#
# This spec is the tie. It asks the real endpoint what each tab holds and writes the answer next to
# the client's own specs, which replay it through the store getters. A change to the server's
# semantics rewrites the fixture here and breaks the client spec that reads it.
