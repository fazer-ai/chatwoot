# A group contact is account-scoped, so one WhatsApp group can belong to two inboxes of
# the same account. Every group action used to resolve its channel by taking whichever
# contact inbox came first, while the dashboard decided what the agent may do from the
# inbox they had open: the panel granted the action using one inbox's capabilities and
# admin status, and the server performed it as another. Leaving is the worst of them,
# because it removes the wrong number from the group.
#
# Asserted on `group_admin#leave`, which is the destructive one, and on the ambiguity
# itself, which every group endpoint answers the same way through the shared concern.
