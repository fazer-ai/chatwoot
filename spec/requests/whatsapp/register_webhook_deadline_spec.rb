# `register_webhook` makes four Graph calls in a row, and a ceiling per call composes with the number of
# calls: four answers that each arrive under the ceiling add up to four ceilings. These examples run the
# endpoint against a Graph that really takes its time, over a real socket, because what is under test is
# the wall clock of the request, and a stub that answers at once has none.
#
# The numbers are the production ones scaled down so the suite stays fast: a 3s ceiling, a 2.5s deadline
# and calls that each take 1s keep the same relationships as 10s, 12s and a slow Meta.

  # The deadline exists to answer before the process is cut from outside. In production `rack-timeout`
  # cuts a request at RACK_TIMEOUT_SERVICE_TIMEOUT, 15s unless an installation sets it, and it does so
  # with a Thread#raise the endpoint's own rescue cannot see. The gem is in the production group, so the
  # number is written here rather than read from it.
