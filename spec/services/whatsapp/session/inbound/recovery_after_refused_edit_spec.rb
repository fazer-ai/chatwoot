# An agent's edit is written before the channel has taken it and written back when the channel refuses
# (#648). A recovery announcement queued for the same row is evaluated against the row when the job runs,
# finds the optimistic body there and stands down (#661) -- and nothing asks again once the refusal puts
# the recovered body back. The rules the recovery exists to re-ask then never run for the body the contact
# actually has (#666).
#
# Driven through the real session pipeline rather than a hand-written row: what makes a row recoverable,
# and what it carries afterwards, is the writer's own business, and a fixture that writes those keys by
# hand would pass while the writer wrote something else.
