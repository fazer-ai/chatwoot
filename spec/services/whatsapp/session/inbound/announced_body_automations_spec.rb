# An announcement that speaks of a body says which body, and the rules are only asked about it while the
# row still holds it. The conditions are evaluated in SQL over the row, never over the payload, and the
# evaluation runs long after the dispatch: a write landing in between would have the rules answer about
# a body the announcement is not about (fazer-ai/chatwoot#661).
#
# The comparison is on the body and not on the edit marker. A row an edit reached first still recovers
# into the same text often enough -- a contact who corrects a typo before the encrypted original lands --
# and standing the arrival's rules down there would cost the #491 delivery for no reason.
#
# `message_created` is deliberately outside all of this: an arrival is about the row appearing, and it
# keeps answering about whatever the row says when the work runs.
