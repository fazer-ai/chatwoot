# An edit replaces the body of a message that is already stored, and until now nothing asked the
# automations about it: `MESSAGE_UPDATED` reaches no rule, and the edit path dispatched nothing else.
# A rule opts into the new trigger, `message_edited`, and the rules of `message_created` are left
# exactly as they were (fazer-ai/chatwoot#648).
#
# Driven through the session dispatcher with the jobs drained, like the recovery's own spec: what is
# under test is which rules run across two events, and a listener called directly would agree with any
# answer about who dispatched what.
