# Brings enterprise/ into the app at boot, from the official tag in VERSION_CW, when the
# edition asks for it. The image itself ships without the tree. Two places are involved:
#
#   storage/.cw-enterprise/<version>-<hash>/enterprise
#       the verified tree, in the volume the stock composes already share between the web
#       and worker containers. One directory per version and hash, published by an atomic
#       rename and never changed afterwards, so a restart or a recreate on the same version
#       needs no network and no container ever sees a tree change under it.
#   tmp/cw-enterprise
#       this container's own activation: a link to that tree, made only with CW_EDITION=ee
#       and removed otherwise. /app/enterprise is a link to it, made at build time. A new
#       container starts without it, so it boots as Community until this helper says
#       otherwise, and what one container decides never reaches another. tmp/ has to be
#       writable, which Rails already needs for its pids and caches.
#
# While tmp/cw-enterprise is missing the chain dangles, and a dangling link does not exist
# as far as Rails is concerned (ChatwootApp.enterprise? asks Pathname#exist?, which follows
# it). A `docker exec ... rails console` sees the same edition as the container's server.
#
#   enterprise.sh ensure          run by every entrypoint before anything boots Rails
#   enterprise.sh lock <out_dir>  build time: download the official tree, write the lock
#   enterprise.sh tree-hash <dir> the hash both sides agree on, for one enterprise/ tree
#
# The hash covers the tree, not the tarball: one sha256 per regular file, in a stable
# order, hashed again. GitHub does not promise byte-stable archives, so hashing the
# download would break on a recompression that changed nothing that runs.
#
# With CW_EDITION=ee, a missing lock, a lock for another version, a download that fails and
# a tree that does not match the lock all stop the boot with a message saying which.
# Booting without enterprise/ instead would quietly turn an Enterprise installation into a
# Community one: custom roles fall back to the plain agent role, SAML sign-in goes away, and
# nothing on screen says why. A container that refuses to start is the louder and safer
# failure. CW_EDITION=ce boots without it, on purpose. An intact tree in the cache is used
# without taking a lock or writing to the volume, so a read-only volume works; only a
# download writes there, under an exclusive lock on storage/.cw-enterprise/.lock.
#
# Settings, both optional:
#   CW_ENTERPRISE_SOURCE_URL     a mirror of the official tarball for the tag. The tree is
#                                checked against the same pinned hash, wherever it came from.
#   CW_ENTERPRISE_FETCH_RETRIES  download attempts after the first one (default 3).
