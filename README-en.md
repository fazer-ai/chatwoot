## About

Chatwoot fazer.ai is a fork of official Chatwoot, maintained by fazer.ai (FAZER.AI LTDA), Chatwoot's official partner in Brazil. Chatwoot Inc. develops the original product and is a separate company.

The fork follows official Chatwoot releases and adds features for teams that set up and operate WhatsApp customer support. You can use the open-source edition for free or subscribe to Chatwoot fazer.ai Pro to add the sales Kanban.

## What fazer.ai adds

### WhatsApp

- Connect by scanning a QR code with your phone, without a paid third-party API, or through the official API with WhatsApp Business app coexistence.
- Change an inbox's connection method without losing its history.
- Import your phone's message history when connecting.
- WhatsApp groups.
- Reactions and quoted replies, plus message editing and deletion.
- Typing and audio recording indicators.
- Voice notes are sent as voice notes instead of audio files.
- Contact profile photos retrieved from WhatsApp.

### Internal team chat

Agents communicate within the support platform, through public or private channels and direct messages.

- Threads and reactions, with conversation mentions.
- Paste or drag files to attach them, with support for message drafts.
- Native notifications and a mobile layout.

The Pro edition provides the full internal chat.

### Conversations and messages

- Scheduled messages, including recurring messages or WhatsApp templates. You can hold a scheduled message if the customer replies first.
- Edit sent messages while retaining their content history.
- Pin conversations or mark them as unread.
- Keep a conversation assigned to the agent who claimed it.
- Per-inbox signatures.
- Personal or shared custom filters, including filters for contacts or conversations missing a custom attribute.

### Automations and integrations

- Triggers for edited messages and conversations idle for a set period.
- Observer bots receive everything that happens in an inbox without replying or taking over conversations. They can classify or review customer support while the team or another bot responds.
- Per-inbox webhooks, with incoming or outgoing message events and retries on failure.
- n8n node: [`@fazer-ai/n8n-nodes-chatwoot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fazer-ai/n8n-nodes-chatwoot).
- [fazer.ai agents](https://fazer.ai/agents): AI agents that handle conversations through either edition of Chatwoot, with [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/fazer-ai/agents).

### Operations

- Interface in Portuguese or the account's language, along with transactional emails and activity messages.
- White labeling with your own name and logo, plus brand colors and branded emails. See [CUSTOM_BRANDING.md](CUSTOM_BRANDING.md).
- Email delivery through Resend and storage through S3-compatible services, such as R2 or MinIO.
- Bulk email imports through IMAP.
- Reports sortable by any column, with cross-tabulated views across agents, inboxes, and teams.

### Chatwoot Enterprise

To use these features with the fork, purchase a license from Chatwoot Inc. and use the `ghcr.io/fazer-ai/chatwoot:latest-ee` image. The image with the `-ee` suffix does not replace the license. The partnership offers a [licensing discount](https://fazer.ai/parceria-chatwoot).

## Install

### With the fazer.ai agents installer

The shortest path is the [fazer.ai agents installer](https://fazer.ai/agents). A coding agent guides the installation of Chatwoot fazer.ai and the AI agent, together with the supporting services, on a VPS.

### Chatwoot only, with Docker

Use the public `ghcr.io/fazer-ai/chatwoot:latest` image. If you have an existing installation, back up the database before replacing the official image and follow the migration steps below.

The repository includes [docker-compose.coolify.yaml](docker-compose.coolify.yaml) and a [Coolify deployment guide](docker/README-coolify-deploy.md), written in Portuguese.

Fork-specific environment variables are documented in [.env.example](.env.example). The public image provides the `latest` tag and a tag for each release.

## Update and migrate from official Chatwoot

### Update

1. Back up the database before changing the image.
2. Pull the new image and restart the services from the panel where Chatwoot runs.

To pin a version, use its release tag instead of `latest`.

### Migrate from official Chatwoot

1. Choose a fork version equal to or newer than your installed version.
2. Back up the database before changing the image.
3. Replace the official image with `ghcr.io/fazer-ai/chatwoot`, using your chosen tag, then restart the services.

Your database and attachments are preserved, along with your settings.
