# A visitor on a public channel can type an email or a phone number, and upstream joins the session
# to whichever contact of the account already holds that value: ContactIdentifyAction merges into
# it, and ContactInboxWithContactBuilder hands a brand-new public API session that contact outright.
# Nothing in those requests proves the visitor is that person, so typing a customer's phone number
# was enough to become the customer: the session lands on their contact, an agent bot's HTTP tools
# get their contact_id and phone, and the human agent reads the visitor's messages under the
# customer's name. Upstream closed the case where the existing contact carries an identifier
# (chatwoot/chatwoot#14935); a contact that came in through an API inbox carries none.
#
# Inside those requests a value that already belongs to another contact is therefore not used to
# find or merge one. It stays on the visitor as an unverified claim in additional_attributes
# (`claimed_email`, `claimed_phone_number`), which the contact panel shows so an agent can confirm
# it or merge the contacts by hand.
#
# A phone number is held back as a claim even when nobody holds it yet. Saved on the contact it is
# the visitor's verified phone to everything downstream: an agent bot's tools get it as
# contact_phone, and whatever an outside system keeps for that number with it, and the real owner
# writing in later through WhatsApp is found by it and lands on the visitor's contact. An email
# nobody holds is still saved, because the reply-by-email of a widget conversation needs it and
# nothing downstream treats it as a credential.
#
# Identifiers in WhatsApp's format ("<lid>@lid", phone and group JIDs) are refused outright: the
# fork's WhatsApp providers store them as contact identifiers, so an unsigned setUser with
# someone's LID would reach their WhatsApp contact, and no site identifies its users that way.
#
# That holds with a valid identifier_hash too: the site signs the identifier and nothing else, so a
# signed-in visitor could otherwise send their own identifier and hash next to someone else's phone.
# The identifier keeps finding and merging its contact as upstream does, signed or, where the inbox
# leaves HMAC optional, unsigned (upstream's contract for setUser without identity validation).
#
# Module prepends rather than edits to upstream files, so an upstream sync never conflicts here
# (config/initializers/unproven_contact_merge_guard.rb).
