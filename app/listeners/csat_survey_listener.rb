  # The status flip and the label the survey rule tests are written by two different jobs. An

  # label land AFTER this listener has already read `label_list` and decided not to send:
  # measured on the Guiche Web email inbox, the label arrives 2s late at p50 and 8s at the worst,
  # and 31 of 87 eligible conversations in one morning lost their survey that way. A single
  # delayed second pass covers that window, and it is scheduled only when the rules were what
  # blocked the survey, so an ordinary resolution still costs exactly one attempt.
