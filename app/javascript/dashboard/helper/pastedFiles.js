/**
 * A zero-byte file is refused everywhere it can be picked, and until now a paste was the one
 * entry point that dropped it without a word. The silence is deliberate and comes from upstream
 * (PR #13135): the macOS Numbers app puts an invalid zero-byte attachment on the clipboard
 * beside the copied cells, so warning on every dropped file would fire on every spreadsheet
 * paste, about a file the person never chose.
 *
 * What separates the two cases is text, and it was measured rather than assumed (macOS,
 * Chromium 153):
 *
 *   - a Numbers copy, one cell or a range, reports `text/plain`, `text/html`, `text/rtf` and
 *     `Files`, the file being `image.png` of `image/png`. Its size is a race, not a state: the
 *     pasteboard promises the image and macOS fills it in afterwards, so a paste in the first
 *     seconds reads 0 bytes and the same clipboard read tens of seconds later gives a real
 *     image (0 then, 10594 bytes at 45 s, measured on the same copy). The empty case is
 *     therefore the window right after Cmd+C, which is also when a person pastes;
 *   - a file copied in Finder reports `Files` alone. The macOS pasteboard does carry the file
 *     name as text, and the browser suppresses every text flavour once a file URL is present,
 *     so the paste event sees no text at all.
 *
 * So the rule is: drop empty files as before, and say so only when the clipboard carried no
 * text. A rich copy that happens to bring an empty attachment stays as quiet as it is today.
