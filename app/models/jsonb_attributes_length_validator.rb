  # `mail_subject` carries whatever the sender typed into the Subject field, and people do write
  # a whole request in there: phone mail clients put the cursor in the subject and some customers
  # never move it to the body. Holding that to the generic limit made the conversation invalid,
  # and the IMAP mailbox then dropped the email without a trace, because the raise happens inside
  # per-message processing and the fetcher just skips the UID. Measured in production on
  # 22/Sep/2026: one subject of 1972 characters, unseen for 21 hours.
  #
  # Still bounded, and deliberately so. `additional_attributes` rides in every conversation
  # payload over ActionCable and webhooks, so an unbounded subject would be paid for on every
  # event of that conversation, forever, by every subscriber. The outgoing reply header is cut
  # separately, at `ConversationReplyMailerHelper::MAX_SUBJECT_LENGTH`, where the value stops
  # being data and becomes an RFC 5322 field.
  #
  # Keyed by attribute as well as by key, because the same validator also guards
  # `custom_attributes`, whose keys are whatever an operator typed into the UI. Without the
  # attribute, an account that happens to define a custom attribute named `mail_subject` would
  # silently inherit the allowance meant for the mailbox.
