  # Everything strictly earlier in the conversation than the cursor message.
  #
  # The cursor is an id, but "earlier" is a question about time, and the two only agree
  # while ids are handed out in the order messages happened. Imported history breaks that
  # by construction: the id comes from the sequence at INSERT and the timestamp is
  # backdated to when the message was sent, so one delivered late carries a newer id and
  # an older timestamp. An `id <` filter drops it from every page, permanently, including
  # the ones reached by scrolling up. Measured on the first imported inbox: 167 of 951
  # messages were unreachable that way, across 18 of 95 conversations.
  #
  # Comparing the pair puts this filter on the axis `page_window` has always ordered by,
  # with the id as the tiebreak that keeps the cursor stable when two messages share a
  # second (WhatsApp timestamps are second-resolution, and a burst lands inside one).
  # Where ids do follow chronology the two predicates select exactly the same rows, so a
  # conversation that never imported anything sees no change at all.
