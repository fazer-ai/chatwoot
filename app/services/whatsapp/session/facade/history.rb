# The history half of the facade: asking a chat for what came before, and whether this
# inbox asked for it at all.
#
# Split out for the same reason the group half is: the facade is at the length the project
# allows, and this is its own subject.
module Whatsapp::Session::Facade::History
  # Asks a chat for the history behind it. Nothing here waits for it: the provider
  # acknowledges the request and the messages arrive as `history.sync` events, if the
  # phone is awake to answer at all, which is why the caller is told the request went out
  # rather than what it produced.
  # `before` is the stored message to page backwards from, or nil to start from the oldest
  # the provider knows. A message rather than an id: the anchor needs its timestamp and its
  # direction too, and the row is the one place that has all three together.
  #
  # A backend that can only page backwards from a message gets the oldest one this inbox
  # holds for the contact, across every thread it opened, which is where the phone's copy
  # and ours stop overlapping. When that one arrived live rather than out of a dump, the
  # phone will not page from it, and the key kept from the archive the import dropped is
  # asked instead (see HistoryAnchors). With nothing to page from, nothing is asked: the
  # answer is false rather than a request the provider refuses.
