# WhatsApp echoes back every message the session sends, including the ones Chatwoot
# itself dispatched. Those echoes are normally recognized by `source_id`, which is
# written from the send response, but when that response is lost and the job retries,
# the echo carries an id Chatwoot never stored: it would land as a new sender-less
# outgoing message, rendered as if an agent had replied from the phone.
#
# Session sends reserve their WhatsApp id before the request (Outbound::SourceIdReservation),
# so the echo is matched on that reservation instead, and the id the response never
# delivered is filled in here.

  # `source_id` from blank to set owes the revoke, decided under the row lock, enqueued

  # and return, while the other writer sees the id already set and enqueues nothing.
