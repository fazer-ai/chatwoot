  # confirming the message exists on WhatsApp — the send response, or the echo promoting a
  # reservation — so a send WE could not confirm has nothing to say about a message the
  # provider already confirmed, and saying it anyway invites the agent to resend a
  # duplicate. Read under the row lock, because the echo can land while the last attempt
  # is still unwinding.
