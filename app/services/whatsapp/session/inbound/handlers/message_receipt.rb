# Delivery receipts for messages this session sent, and read marks the contact made.
class Whatsapp::Session::Inbound::Handlers::MessageReceipt < Whatsapp::Session::Inbound::Handlers::Base
  # One query for the whole batch. A receipt is a batch by nature and a large one by
  # habit: opening a chat produced a single read event naming 246 messages, most of them
  # from before the inbox existed, and a lookup per id put hundreds of round trips on the
  # queue that inbound messages share.
  #
  # Never deferred, unlike the events that mutate one message. Waiting for the ids it
  # names would replay that whole batch five times over the ones that are never coming,
  # and losing a receipt is self-correcting in a way that losing a revoke is not: the
  # next one on the chat carries the same marker forward.
