# guards have to hold for the family as a whole.

  # It lives here rather than in either importer because it is not only the importer's
  # business. It is the longest anything holds a chat key, so it is also the floor for the

  # Takes every id the chat can be addressed by, because WhatsApp names the same 1:1 peer
  # by phone in one event and by LID in the next: locking only the one an event happens
  # to carry lets two workers each find no conversation and open one. The ids are locked
  # in a fixed order, so two workers holding different aliases cannot deadlock, and each
  # is released by token: `Redis::LockManager#unlock` deletes unconditionally, so an
  # operation that outran the TTL (syncing a large group roster is the realistic one)

  # waiter when it cannot have the key.

  # is long, and a live message beside them can lose every attempt it has against a lock
  # that is never free at the moment it looks -- a retry budget covers one holder, and what
  # it is really up against is a queue of them. And an import that noted itself would be
  # standing aside for its own siblings, which is a deadlock spelled differently.
