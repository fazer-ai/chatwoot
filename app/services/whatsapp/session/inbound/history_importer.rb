# Files a batch of history into the inbox.
#
# What arrives is one undifferentiated pile: the phone answers a request with everything
# it has for a chat, and answers the first connection with everything it has, full stop.
# One live instance answered a request for fifty messages with nine hundred and forty
# seven. So the policy on volume, on status and on what may be set off is applied here, on
# the way in, and never assumed of the provider.
#
# Two decisions run through it, and they are not the same decision:
#
#   what it is       Inbound::Coverage splits the pile against the last moment the inbox
#                    was known to be receiving. Newer means nobody has had the chance to
#                    read it: that is late mail and it belongs in the queue. Older is
#                    history and it belongs in the archive, filed resolved.
#   what it may do   almost nothing. Import::SilentWrite holds for the whole
#                    run, so no imported message notifies, automates, posts a webhook,
#                    wakes a bot or answers with a template, whichever half it lands in.
#                    The one exception follows the same split: the gap half is written
#                    announcing, so the queue an operator is watching updates itself,
#                    while the archive stays silent because a reader has nothing to gain
#                    from eight hundred backdated rows arriving one cable frame at a time,
#                    unless the pile answers a press of the button: then somebody is
#                    watching the thread for exactly those rows (`announce`).
