# Sends again a teardown the connector says it never attempted.
#
# `session.delete` and `session.logout` are published, not called: nothing waits for them,
# and their failures come back later as `command.failed` on the event stream. One answer
# there is a promise rather than a failure. `not_attempted` is the connector certain that
# nothing reached WhatsApp -- the socket was being dialled and the unlink was never called
# -- so the device is still linked on somebody's phone, and the contract tells a client to
# send the same command again. Treated as final it stays linked for good, because the
# credentials that would sign the unlink are the ones a later teardown throws away.
#
# Only that answer. `retryable?` says a retry might answer differently, which is true of
# the whole ProviderUnavailable family and says nothing about whether a teardown is still
# owed: `session_not_found` is retryable by that definition and means the teardown is
# already done.
#
# The answer usually arrives for a session no inbox holds any more (the inbox was
# destroyed or moved to another provider), which is why the consumer hands it here before
# dropping it as an orphan. The one inbox that can still be around is one an operator
# disconnected, and for that one what counts is the request, not the connection record:
# the backend notes the teardown when it sends it and withdraws the note when it is asked
# to connect, while `close` is also what any dropped connection writes and `open` is what
# a redial the teardown was racing writes.
