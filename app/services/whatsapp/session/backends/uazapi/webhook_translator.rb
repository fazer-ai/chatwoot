# One webhook body from this provider, turned into canonical events.
#
# The envelope has three shapes, keyed by `EventType`: a connection carries `instance`, a
# message carries `message` (plus a large CRM object this layer ignores), and everything
# else carries `event`. What they have in common is `token`, the instance credential,
# which is why nothing here copies the body into an event: `raw` stays empty rather than
# carrying a secret into a job argument, a log line and a database row.
#
# A body this build does not understand produces no events at all. That is what lets a
# provider add an event type, or an operator subscribe to more than Chatwoot asked for,
# without the inbox failing on every delivery.

  # stable (a peer reading answers `Read`, our own `/message/markread` answers `read`),
  # while `state` was consistent across every capture.
  #
  # `FileDownloaded` is the provider's own bookkeeping and means nothing here.
