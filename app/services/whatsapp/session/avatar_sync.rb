# The two markers `Avatar::AvatarFromUrlJob` keeps on a Contact to avoid refetching the
# same picture: the last sync time (a one minute rate limit) and a hash of the URL it
# already fetched. That job stamps both even on the run it skipped, so anything that
# knows the stored avatar is out of date has to clear them first or its refresh is
# dropped, and so is every later attempt at the same URL.
#
# Three callers know that: the contact picture-changed event, the forced group photo
# refresh, and the group rejoin snapshot.
