# Provider-neutral layer for the "session" family of WhatsApp channels: providers that
# pair against a phone (QR code or pairing code) and speak the multi-device protocol,
# as opposed to the hosted Cloud API family (`default`, `whatsapp_cloud`).
#
# Two backends ship with it: `native` (our Go connector, over Redis Streams) and
# `uazapi` (HTTP + webhook). `baileys` and `zapi` are the frozen legacy of the same
# family: they keep their own services and are only converted away from.
#
# Everything above the Backend boundary speaks the canonical model in
# Whatsapp::Session::Model. No JID, no provider payload and no provider name leaks
# into handlers, jobs or the outbound path.
module Whatsapp::Session
  # Major of the wire contract in spec/fixtures/whatsapp/session/contract. Additive
  # changes (new event type, new optional field) do not bump it; a drift spec keeps
  # this constant and the vendored PROTOCOL_VERSION in sync.
  PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1

  # Providers served by this layer. Legacy session providers are NOT here: they are
  # described by the registry (so the UI can label them) but routed to their own services.
