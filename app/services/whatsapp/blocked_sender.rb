# The one rule every WhatsApp inbound path applies to a blocked contact, the same one
# upstream's Cloud path applies in `IncomingMessageBaseService#contact_processable?`: what
# the contact sends is not filed, so it opens no conversation and reaches no bot, while the
# echo of a reply the owner typed on the phone is still filed, or the agent's own answer
# would go missing from the thread. Taking a reaction back is not a new message: the paths
# reconcile it before asking this, as upstream does.
#
# Asked as the first thing after the sender's contact is resolved. Not before: the
# read-only lookup (`Session::Inbound::ContactLookup`) only finds a contact that already
# has a contact_inbox on the inbox, and a blocked contact created through the API has none.
#
# spec/services/whatsapp/blocked_sender_contract_spec.rb lists every inbound entry point and
# fails on one that has not said whether it files what a contact sends.
