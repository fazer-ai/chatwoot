# What a credential check answers when it could not reach a verdict.
#
# `validate_provider_config?` has two honest answers, the credential works or the provider refused it,
# and a boolean can only say those two. The third outcome is that nothing came back that says either:
# the socket timed out, the connection was refused, the provider answered that it could not answer
# right now, or answered something this side cannot read. Returned as `false`, that becomes "Invalid
# Credentials" to an operator whose credentials may be perfect; left to escape, it becomes a 500 that
# says the application broke (fazer-ai/chatwoot#598). So it is raised as its own class, and the one
# caller, `Channel::Whatsapp#validate_provider_config`, turns it into a validation error of its own.
#
# The rescue here is wide on purpose and narrow in scope, the same arrangement as
# Whatsapp::TransportFailure: anything StandardError can be at the HTTP call is a transport failure by
# construction, and an enumerated list would be a promise to have thought of every way a socket can
# fail. What keeps it honest is that nothing but the call sits under the rescue, which is why this takes
# the call's arguments instead of a block: they are evaluated by the caller, so the code of ours that
# builds the URL, the headers or the body runs outside it, as in `post_outgoing`. A defect of our own,
# a NoMethodError while building the request, between the requests or while reading an answer, is not a
# check that failed to conclude, and must not reach the operator as one: it escapes as itself.
module Whatsapp::CredentialCheck
  class Unavailable < StandardError; end

  # A 5xx is the provider, or whatever stands in front of it, saying it cannot answer right now. A 429

  # For a body the verdict depends on. HTTParty parses lazily and by the Content-Type it was given, so
  # bad JSON is not the only way to fail here: a gateway answering broken XML raises MultiXML::ParseError.
  # Only the parse sits under the rescue, so it is wide for the same reason as the request's. When the
  # answer is already known, as with a refusal whose body only feeds a log line, an unreadable body must
  # not change it: rescue Unavailable around this call.
