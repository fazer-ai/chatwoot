# The phone sends this on its own after a pairing, and again after every reconnect, and it
# answers an explicit request with it. Baileys types the dump, which is the fact that makes
# this provider worth keeping alive for one more feature: `RECENT` is WhatsApp replaying
# what arrived while the device was offline, so a Baileys inbox can recover a disconnect
# that no other provider we serve can.
#
# The dump arrives in frames (see historySync.ts on the bridge), each one a slice of one
# `messaging-history.set` under the byte budget. Every frame is filed on its own: order
# between them carries no meaning, since the importer sorts by timestamp and deduplicates
# by provider id.
