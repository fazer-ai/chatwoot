  # Rides only the send_stall_detected webhook: the connection is receiving and answering
  # health checks while every send times out. Worth surfacing on its own rather than as a
  # bare error string, because "action" is what tells an operator whether the provider
  # already recreated the socket or is holding off until `until` — and holding off is when
  # a human has to step in, which is why it is serialized to admins rather than kept for
  # support (quarantine, by contrast, still is).
  #
  # Unlike quarantine, this does NOT share the error's lifecycle. The provider reports a
  # stall once per episode, so an unrelated update in the meantime (a standalone
  # reachoutTimeLock push carries no sendStall) would clear the warning for good while the
  # connection is still mute — and nothing would ever say it again. So it is preserved,
  # and cleared only by the one event that actually means recovery: the connection
  # reaching `open` with nothing wrong, which is a NEW socket and therefore a new keystore
  # mutex, whether the provider restarted it or WhatsApp dropped it.

  # provider DOES send reachoutTimeLock (including isActive:false to lift the restriction), we
