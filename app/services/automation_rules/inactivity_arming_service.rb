# writes the same clock. That is why it does not go through the message run claims, which exist to
# keep an action from happening twice and, applied to an arm, suppress real activity: an edit that
# restores a body the rule already saw reuses that body's finished claim, and the deadline that
# should have moved never does. Nothing here is customer-facing, so there is nothing to deduplicate.
