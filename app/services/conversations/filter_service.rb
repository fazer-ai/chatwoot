  # Folders and ad-hoc filters go through here, and until now they ignored `sort_by`
  # entirely: the list came back newest-first no matter what the agent picked, while the

  # sort control is hidden in that view, so the disagreement was invisible rather than
  # broken-looking, and a team working a folder oldest-first had no way to ask for it.
