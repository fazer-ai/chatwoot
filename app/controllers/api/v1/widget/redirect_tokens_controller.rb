  # without carrying an identifier at all: an already-identified customer then walked past this guard

  # target and its contact was destroyed — a link meant for someone else taking a customer's history

  # THE VISITOR JOINS THE CONTACT THE TOKEN NAMES, and does not merely claim to be it.
  #
  # `ContactIdentifyAction` decides by the identifier: it merges the visitor onto whoever holds the
  # value and ASSIGNS the value when nobody does. Assigning is right for a self-declared `setUser`
  # identity and wrong for a redirect a contact was named for — the value belongs to that contact by
  # construction, so handing it to a browser session that merely presented a token leaves the lead
  # with two contacts, the second squatting the identifier every later redirect for it needs
  # (fazer-ai/agents#286, and the orphan #269 measured in production).
  #
  # So the merge is done against the NAMED contact rather than against whoever the identifier
  # currently points at. A contact that is gone identifies nobody: the visitor stays anonymous, which
  # is the same place a failed crossing already left it, rather than being handed a dead lead's value.
  #
  # The identifier is written only onto a contact that has NONE. A named contact carrying a different
  # value has been re-identified since the token was minted — identifiers are mutable through the
  # contacts API and the ingestion services — and a link from yesterday is not evidence about today,
  # so it unifies without touching what the contact now says it is.

    # orphan this prevents, and its token can still be live. `identifier` is unique per account, so a
    # bang answers 422 out of the widget endpoint, which is worse than the state it was repairing:
    # the lead cannot enter the chat at all. The unification already happened above and stands either
    # way; the identifier is a convenience for the next mint, which settles it again anyway.
    return if @contact.update(identifier: payload['identifier'])

    # A refused write leaves the attempted value DIRTY on this instance, and this instance is what
    # the cloned message is created with. `Message.create!` builds its payload from it and the SYNC
    # dispatcher hands that to agent bots and websockets, so the rejected identifier would be
    # announced as though it had been stored — and the message's own save re-runs the uniqueness
    # validation and answers 422, which is what the spec measured before this line existed.

  # The order here is load-bearing. AgentBotListener is on the SYNC dispatcher, so the payload a
  # consumer receives for the cloned message is built INSIDE Message.create!, from the conversation as
  # it stands at that moment. The pairing therefore has to be on the row before the message exists, or
  # the message — the event a consumer actually acts on — carries the PREVIOUS episode's origin.
  #
  # Measured on a running instance, mint + resolve over HTTP with an agent bot on the widget inbox:
  #
  #   origin changes, cloned message   ->  1. conversation_updated (new origin)
  #                                        2. message_created      (new origin)
  #   origin changes, no message       ->  1. conversation_updated (new origin)
  #   origin unchanged, cloned message ->  1. message_created      (new origin)
  #   origin unchanged, no message     ->  nothing
  #
  # So the update PRECEDES the message rather than following it, and that is the point: every event a
  # consumer can see already names the right origin. The standalone update is not a second trigger —
  # it states a value, and a consumer that acts on episodes acts on the customer message, which is the
  # only thing either path produces that is one.

  # The pairing and the message it belongs to, under ONE lock, because the invariant above is about
  # the two TOGETHER: the message's payload is built from the conversation as it stands when
  # Message.create! runs, so the pairing has to still be this request's when it does. Two
  # message-bearing redirects resuming the same conversation at once break that if the lock ends with
  # the origin write — A writes 77 and releases, B writes 91 and finishes, then A's message goes out
  # naming 77 while the row says 91, and a consumer mirroring that message disagrees with Chatwoot
  # about which WhatsApp thread this episode has. Held across both, the two requests serialize whole:
  # whichever commits last owns the row AND sent the last message, and they name the same origin.
  #
  # A conversation born in this request is RELOADED first, then locked like any other. Skipping the
  # lock there was reasoned from "nothing could have raced a row that did not exist", and that stops
  # being true the moment the INSERT commits: a second resume can load the same conversation and move
  # its origin, and this request would then build its message from a cached origin the row no longer
  # holds. What the born-here case actually needs is only the reload — a just-created Conversation
  # still carries an unpersisted `display_id` change (Chatwoot assigns it around the insert) and
  # `with_lock` refuses to lock a record holding unpersisted changes rather than discard them
  # silently. Reloading discards exactly that, and costs one SELECT on the path that creates a row.

  # The pairing, written at the one moment it is a fact rather than an inference. Everything this
  # side knows afterwards is about the CONTACT, and a contact carries neither the conversation the
  # link was minted on nor which of its threads the lead came from — five different predicates over
  # the mirrored rows were tried downstream and each is wrong in its own way (fazer-ai/agents#222).
  #
  # Last write wins: a token is burned by exactly one click, so the value is always the origin of the
  # redirect that just happened, which is the episode the follow-up ladder acts on.
  #
  # A token that names NO origin clears it, rather than leaving the previous one standing. Consuming a
  # token is the one event that sets this column, so a re-entry that cannot say where it came from
  # leaves the stored answer with nothing behind it — the lead came back through a link this instance
  # cannot attribute. Keeping it would hand a consumer that MESSAGES and RESOLVES the named
  # conversation full confidence in a previous episode's answer; clearing it sends that consumer to
  # whatever it does with no answer at all, which is a decision it makes knowingly.
  #
  # Note the asymmetry with the consumer's own /reset, which deliberately KEEPS the pairing
  # (fazer-ai/agents#355): a reset is not a redirect and does not un-click the link, so the stored
  # answer is still the last true one. Here a redirect did happen and did not name an origin.
  #
  # On the message-less path this update is the ONLY thing that happens, so it has to be observable on
  # its own — nothing is created and no message is sent. That is why the column is in
  # Conversation#list_of_keys: the update then emits its own conversation_updated, carrying the new
  # pairing and a fresh `updated_at` for consumers to order it by.
  # The equality check is write avoidance and nothing more: ActiveRecord records no change for a write
  # of the same value, so `previous_changes` comes back empty and notify_conversation_updation returns
  # before dispatching anything. Removing this line leaves every event this endpoint emits identical
  # and only adds an UPDATE per repeated click — measured, because a repeated link from ONE WhatsApp
  # conversation is a supported flow and it would be easy to read the silence as this guard's doing.
  # `.presence` normalizes for the equality check below and nothing else: an integer column casts ''
  # to nil on assignment (measured), so a malformed token writes nil either way — but `nil == ''` is
  # false, so without it the guard would miss and spend an UPDATE that changes nothing. That is why
  # deleting it leaves the specs green.
  #
  # But it has to compare against the ROW, not against an instance loaded before the token was even
  # resolved, and the lock its caller holds is what makes those the same thing: `with_lock` reloads
  # under SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, so the comparison sees whatever a concurrent resume committed and
  # this request's own token still gets the last word. Take that lock away and the window does not
  # merely re-open — a stale instance holding this request's own origin makes the guard skip, and
  # skipping is silent on both counts: no write, and no conversation_updated for the message-less
  # path. Dropping the guard instead does not help either, because ActiveRecord issues no UPDATE for
  # a value the instance already believes it has. The staleness is the defect; the guard only reads
  # it out.

  # A brand-new conversation carries the pairing from birth, so the row is right from its first

  # runs before the message on the resume path.
  #
  # No agent bot hears about the creation itself, and that is upstream behaviour rather than
  # something this change can set: AgentBotListener handles conversation_resolved, opened,
  # status_changed, updated, message_created, message_updated and webwidget_triggered, and no
  # conversation_created. Measured — a message-less token that creates the conversation delivers an
  # empty list of bot events. Nothing is lost by it: the pairing is on the row, so the FIRST event a
  # bot does receive for this conversation carries it, and until a message exists there is no episode
  # for a consumer to act on. Making creation bot-visible would change the agent-bot contract for
  # every inbox in the account, which is not this change's to make (fazer-ai/agents#222).
