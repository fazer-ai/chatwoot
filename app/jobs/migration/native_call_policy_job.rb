# Asks the connector again for every native inbox that has a session to resume, so that none
# of them goes on with a call policy this installation no longer sends.
#
# First written for fazer-ai/chatwoot#850, when inboxes paired while the session layer asked
# the connector to refuse every call needed a new connect to stop doing it. Run again when
# calling through the connector was withdrawn: an inbox that had calling on was connected
# with `calls.answer`, and the connector keeps the policy of the last connect and stands on it
# when the session comes back, so without a new connect it would go on answering calls that
# nobody here takes. The `calling_enabled` flag such an inbox kept is cleared first, so the
# record no longer says calls are on.
#
# A connector call still ringing or under way at the upgrade is ended here too: nothing
# reads its `call.terminate` any more, so it would stay open for good, block the next call
# and come back as ringing whenever its message is loaded. Only calls of the session inboxes:
# a Cloud API call is Enterprise's, and its end still arrives through Meta.
#
# Each inbox goes through ApplyProxyJob, which sends the whole desired state and retries while
# the connector is down. They are spread a few at a time, the pacing of the
# `whatsapp:session:reassert` rake: `wa:control` is one stream for the whole fleet, and every
# account asked dials.
#
# Run again by hand: Migration::NativeCallPolicyJob.perform_now
