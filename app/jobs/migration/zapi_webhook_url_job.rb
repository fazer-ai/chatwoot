# Moves every Z-API inbox from the old webhook URL, which carried only the phone number, to the
# one that carries a token. Until the new URL is confirmed the old one keeps taking the inbox's
# events, so an inbox this job cannot reach (Z-API down, credentials revoked) keeps working the
# way it did and is listed in the log. So is an instance whose webhooks do not all point at the
# old URL: re-registering overwrites every one of them, and the job does not take over an event
# someone sent elsewhere. Setting the inbox up again from its settings page moves either kind.
