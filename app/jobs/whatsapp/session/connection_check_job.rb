# (a hosted instance can be disconnected from its own dashboard, or simply stop), and the
# account limits, which are never pushed. Both are read, never re-connected: re-arming a
# session that is up is the connector's job on its own side, and asking a hosted provider
# to connect every five minutes would re-register the webhook for nothing.
