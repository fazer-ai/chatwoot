# Asks for every history file one conversation is still missing, whatever its age.

# What the "download this conversation's files" action queues: somebody needs the context
# of one chat, often an old group, which the inbox's window leaves out on purpose. One file
# at a time, like the inbox's drain, so a large group does not flood the
# provider; a file that is already there or was given up on is skipped by `pending?`, so a
# second press only asks for what the first did not get.
