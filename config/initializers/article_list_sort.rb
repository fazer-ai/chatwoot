# The Articles tab of the help center lists every article of the portal in one place, and upstream
# always orders it by the last update (#811). With a few dozen articles, finding one meant knowing
# its title well enough to search for it. The tab now asks for an order: one of the fields below,
# prefixed with `-` for descending, the format the contacts list already uses.
#
# A category keeps the manual order: it is the order the public portal shows, and the one an agent
# edits by dragging, so the tab's choice does not reach it.
#
# Declared here instead of as an autoloaded class, for the reason import_guards.rb gives: a
# reloadable module handed to `prepend` is a new object after every reload. Prepended rather than
# edited in, because the controller is upstream's and every line there is a conflict on every sync.

  # Title ignores case so the order does not depend on the database collation: under "C", the one
  # some self-hosted Postgres images ship with, "Zebra" would come before "apple". An article never
  # viewed has no count rather than 0, and the card shows it as 0, so that is where it sorts.
