# Two changes to how a conversation is handed to an agent bot (#721). Upstream is kept on purpose
# where it chose: any bot of the account can still be assigned through the API, and the assigned
# bot gets the conversation's events (AgentBotListener#agent_bots_for, chatwoot/chatwoot#12836),
# which is what delegating to a specialist bot relies on.
#
# Declared here instead of as autoloaded classes, for the reason import_guards.rb gives: a
# reloadable module handed to `prepend` is a new object after every reload. Prepended rather than
# edited in, because the four files involved are upstream's and every line there is a conflict on
# every sync.
module AgentBotAssignment
  # The assignee dropdown listed every bot of the account, so the bot answering a WhatsApp inbox was
  # one click away from an e-mail conversation it had never been set up for; in production that
  # conversation sat in pending for five days with no owner. The dropdown now offers the inbox's own
  # active bot, and the bots connected to no inbox of the account, global ones included, which is
  # where a specialist bot lives. Any other connection takes a bot off the list, whatever its status
  # and whatever the inbox: an inactive one still says which inbox the bot was built for, and an
  # observer (AgentBotObserver) never answers, so handing it a conversation strands it the same way.
  #
  # With several inboxes asked for, a bot has to pass for each of them, the rule agents already
  # follow in the same action.

  # Assigning a user writes "Assigned to <agent> by <user>"; assigning a bot wrote "Conversation

  # out, as nobody assigned it.
